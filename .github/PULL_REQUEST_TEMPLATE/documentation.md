# Documentation Reorganization

## Description
This PR reorganizes the project documentation to improve maintainability and clarity.

## Changes Made
- Created structured documentation directories:
  - `/docs/deployment/` - Deployment-related documentation
  - `/docs/development/` - Development guidelines and standards
  - `/docs/design/` - Visual design and brand documentation
  - `/docs/legacy/` - Archive of older documentation
- Consolidated similar documentation files
- Created comprehensive guides:
  - Deployment Guide
  - Development Guide
  - Visual Design System
- Created a documentation index with proper links
- Moved legacy/outdated documentation to a separate directory

## Why These Changes Are Needed
The previous documentation structure had many overlapping files and lacked clear organization, making it difficult to find specific information. This reorganization makes it easier to:
1. Find specific documentation
2. Maintain documentation as the project evolves
3. Onboard new developers quickly

## Testing Performed
- Verified all documentation links are working
- Checked for consistent formatting
- Ensured no information was lost in the consolidation

## Additional Notes
The `gh-pages` branch remains unchanged as it contains only the compiled website files.
