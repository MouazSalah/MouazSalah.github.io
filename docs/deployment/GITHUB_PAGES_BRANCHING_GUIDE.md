# GitHub Pages & Branching Guide

This guide explains the branch structure in this repository and how GitHub Pages deployment works, following DevOps Visions standards.

## Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Main development branch containing the source code, documentation, and configuration
- **`gh-pages`**: Deployment branch containing only the built application (generated output only)

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project deploys to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` branch, which contains only the production build output from the application.

### Important Notes

1. **Never merge the `gh-pages` branch into `main`**
   - The `gh-pages` branch contains only build output and should never be merged into source branches
   - GitHub may suggest a "Compare & pull request" for `gh-pages` → `main`, but these should always be ignored

2. **Default Branch**
   - The repository uses `main` as the default branch (previously `master`)
   - Changing the default branch will not affect GitHub Pages, as it's configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch

3. **Deployment Process**
   - The deployment process builds the application and pushes the result to the `gh-pages` branch
   - This is handled by the scripts in the `/scripts/deployment` directory (`deploy.ps1`, `sync-gh-pages.ps1`, etc.)

4. **Standard Structure**
   - The `gh-pages` branch should contain only:
     - `index.html` (built version)
     - Assets directory with compiled JS/CSS
     - Static assets required by the website
     - A minimal README.md explaining the branch's purpose

## Automation for Branch Protection

The repository includes automation to help prevent accidental merges:

1. Pull requests from `gh-pages` get automatically labeled with "do-not-merge"
2. A `.mergeignore` file lists branches that should not be merged into other branches
3. The PR validation workflow checks for and warns about prohibited branch merges

## Manual Branch Management

If you need to manually change settings related to branches:

1. **Change Default Branch**
   - Go to repository Settings → Branches
   - Click the switch icon (↓↑) next to "Default branch"
   - Select your desired branch and confirm

2. **Branch Protection**
   - Go to repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
   - Add rules to prevent direct pushes or require reviews
