# Review Process

This document outlines the standard review process for DevOps Visions projects.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Creation**
   - Create a branch following naming conventions
   - Make focused, logical commits
   - Open a pull request with a thorough description
   - Reference related issues

2. **Self-Review**
   - Ensure code meets standards and conventions
   - Run all tests locally
   - Verify functionality works as expected
   - Use linters and formatters to catch common issues

3. **CI Verification**
   - Automated tests must pass
   - Code coverage should meet or exceed project requirements
   - Linting and formatting checks should pass
   - Security scanning should not identify issues

4. **Peer Review**
   - At least one approval from a team member
   - Reviewers should check:
     - Functionality
     - Code quality and readability
     - Security considerations
     - Performance implications
     - Test coverage

5. **Addressing Feedback**
   - Respond to all review comments
   - Make requested changes or explain why they shouldn't be made
   - Request re-review after addressing feedback

6. **Merging**
   - Squash commits for cleaner history if appropriate
   - Use a descriptive merge commit message
   - Delete branch after merging

## Review Criteria

### Functionality
- Does the code work as intended?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is input validation sufficient?

### Quality
- Does the code follow style guidelines?
- Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- Is there sufficient documentation?
- Are there appropriate comments for complex logic?

### Testing
- Are there unit tests for new functionality?
- Are there integration tests for complex interactions?
- Do tests cover edge cases?

### Security
- Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data properly handled?
- Are inputs properly validated and sanitized?

### Performance
- Are there potential performance bottlenecks?
- Are resources used efficiently?
- Is there excessive complexity?

## Special Review Guidelines for Elmentor Landing Page

Due to the critical nature of the website functionality, additional checks are required:

1. **Website Safety Check**
   - Verify PR does not modify files in \src/\ directory
   - Verify PR does not modify files in \public/\ directory
   - Verify PR does not modify build configuration files
   - Verify PR does not modify deployment scripts

2. **Documentation Review**
   - Documentation changes should be accurate and aligned with DevOps Visions standards
   - New documentation should follow the established structure
   - All documentation should emphasize the importance of preserving website functionality

3. **Repository Structure Review**
   - Structural changes should enhance organization without affecting website functionality
   - New directories and files should follow naming conventions
   - Template files should include website safety checks

If a PR does require website changes (which should be rare and carefully considered):
1. The PR must use the special website changes template
2. The PR must be reviewed by at least two maintainers
3. The PR must include thorough testing and a rollback plan
