# Navigation Fix Documentation

## Problem
When using HashRouter with React Router, clicking on navigation links that use standard HTML anchor links (`href="#section-id"`) triggers the router's navigation, causing a "Page Not Found" error because the router tries to find a route that matches the anchor part as a path.

## Solution Implemented
We fixed the navigation system by:

1. Enhancing the `NAV_LINKS` array to include both the `href` and `id` of each section
2. Creating a custom `handleSectionNavigation` function that:
   - Prevents the default anchor link behavior
   - Scrolls to the appropriate section using `scrollIntoView()`
   - Updates the URL hash without triggering a full page navigation using `window.history.replaceState()`
3. Applied this custom navigation handler to:
   - All desktop navigation links
   - All mobile navigation links  
   - The logo link

## Benefits
- Navigation links now correctly scroll to the intended sections
- The URL properly updates to include the section hash
- No more "Page Not Found" errors when clicking navigation links
- Maintains a clean user experience with smooth scrolling

## Technical Notes
When using React Router's HashRouter with anchor links that target elements within a page, you need to prevent the default behavior and handle the scrolling manually. This is because HashRouter treats everything after the `#` as a route path, not as an element ID to scroll to.

This solution separates concerns:
- HashRouter handles actual route changes (e.g., between main page and Arabic page)
- Our custom navigation handler manages scrolling to page sections
