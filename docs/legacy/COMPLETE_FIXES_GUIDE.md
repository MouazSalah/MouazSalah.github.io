# Complete Guide: Navigation and Base Path Fixes

## Issues Fixed

We've addressed two major issues:

1. **Navigation Links Not Working**: Clicking navbar links was showing a "Page Not Found" error.
2. **Blank Page in Preview/Production**: The site showed a blank page when accessed at the deployed path.

## Technical Root Causes

### Navigation Issue
The problem occurred because of a conflict between React Router's HashRouter and traditional HTML anchor links. When using HashRouter, the hash part of the URL (`#section-id`) is interpreted as a route path, not as an element ID to scroll to.

### Blank Page Issue
The blank page issue was caused by incorrectly configured base paths in Vite. When the app was built and previewed, the assets were being loaded from the wrong paths because the base path wasn't consistently set across different environments.

## Complete Solutions Implemented

### 1. Navigation Fix

- Enhanced `NAV_LINKS` array with both `href` and `id` properties
- Created a custom `handleSectionNavigation` function that:
  ```typescript
  const handleSectionNavigation = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement>, sectionId: string) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    closeMenu();
    
    const section = document.getElementById(sectionId);
    if (section) {
      section.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
      
      // Update URL without triggering navigation
      const newUrl = window.location.pathname + window.location.search + '#' + sectionId;
      window.history.replaceState(null, '', newUrl);
    }
  };
  ```
- Applied this function to all navigation links in desktop and mobile menus
- Updated the logo link to use the same navigation mechanism

### 2. Base Path Fix

- Updated Vite configuration to use dynamic base paths:
  ```typescript
  export default defineConfig(({ command }) => {
    const config = {
      // Common config...
    }
    
    // Set the base path depending on the mode
    if (command === 'build' || command === 'serve') {
      // For production build and preview
      config.base = '/elmentor-landing-page-clean/'
    } else {
      // For development
      config.base = '/'
    }
    
    return config
  })
  ```

## Testing Both Fixes Together

### Development Mode Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Access: http://localhost:3000/
3. Test all navigation links
4. Verify smooth scrolling to sections
5. Check URL hash updates correctly

### Production Mode Testing
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Preview: `npm run preview`
3. Access: http://localhost:4173/elmentor-landing-page-clean/
4. Verify site loads correctly (not blank page)
5. Test all navigation links
6. Verify assets (images, CSS, JS) load properly

## Deployment Instructions

### Simple Deployment
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy:gh-pages
```

### Verified Deployment with Checks
Run the script:
```bash
./deploy-with-basepath.ps1
```

This script:
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Builds with correct base path
3. Verifies the index.html has correct paths
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Future Improvements

- Add active state styling to currently visible section in navbar
- Implement smoother scroll behavior with offset for fixed header
- Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility
- Implement proper scroll restoration when navigating between routes
- Add automated tests for navigation functionality
