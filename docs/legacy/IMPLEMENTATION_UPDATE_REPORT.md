## Fixed Issues

1. **Added Community Gathering Section**
   - Created new `CommunityGatheringSection` component with Tokyo, Cairo, and Seattle gatherings
   - Added placeholder images for each gathering location
   - Implemented responsive card layout with location and date information
   - Added "Message Eng Mohamed Radwan on Facebook" CTA button

2. **Fixed Hero Section Background**
   - Updated background color to use dark blue gradient (primary-950 to primary-900)
   - Changed text colors to white for better contrast
   - Ensured all elements are properly visible against dark background

3. **Added Contact Form Alternative**
   - Implemented "Contact Form Coming Soon" message
   - Added direct link to message Eng Mohamed Radwan on Facebook
   - Styled contact section with proper blue background matching the original design

## Layout and Order
The sections now appear in the correct order:
1. Hero Section
2. About Section
3. Circles Section
4. Activities Section
5. Founder Section
6. Benefits Section
7. Introductory Video Section
8. News Section
9. **Community Gathering Section** (newly added)

## Visual Consistency
- Ensured consistent color scheme using Microsoft Blue theme (primary colors)

- Preserved appropriate spacing and layout across all sections

## Next Steps
