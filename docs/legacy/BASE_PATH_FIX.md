# Update for Router and Base Path Configuration

## Issue Fixed: Blank Page in Preview Mode

We've addressed the issue with the blank page appearing when accessing the application in preview mode at `http://localhost:4173/elmentor-landing-page-clean/`. The problem was related to how Vite handles base paths in different environments.

## Technical Solution

We implemented a dynamic base path configuration in `vite.config.ts` that correctly sets the base path depending on whether the app is running in:
- Development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Build mode (`npm run build`)
- Preview mode (`npm run preview`)

This ensures that all assets are loaded correctly regardless of the environment.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Vite Configuration**:
   - Modified `vite.config.ts` to use a dynamic configuration based on the command
   - Set the base path to '/elmentor-landing-page-clean/' for production and preview
   - Set the base path to '/' for development

2. **Created a Test Script**:
   - Added `test-preview.ps1` to facilitate testing the preview server
   - The script builds the project and starts the preview server
   - Provides clear instructions for manual testing

## How This Complements the Navigation Fix

This update works together with our previous navigation fix:

1. The navigation links now properly scroll to sections using our custom handler
2. The assets load correctly because the base path is properly configured
3. The URL structure stays consistent between development and production

## Testing the Updated Configuration

1. Development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Site should load at: http://localhost:3000/

2. Preview mode (after build):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   Site should load at: http://localhost:4173/elmentor-landing-page-clean/

3. Production deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy:gh-pages
   ```
   Site should load at: https://aymanaboghonim.github.io/elmentor-landing-page-clean/

## Verification Steps

- Check that all assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) load correctly
- Verify that navigation between sections works properly
- Confirm that URL hash changes when navigating
- Test both desktop and mobile views
