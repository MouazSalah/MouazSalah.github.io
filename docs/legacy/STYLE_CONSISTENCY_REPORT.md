1. **Added Microsoft Blue Color Scale**:
   - Added a comprehensive blue color scale from 50 to 950
   - Properly defined all primary color variations needed for backgrounds, text, and UI elements
   - Ensured color variables follow design system best practices

2. **Dark Blue Backgrounds**:
   - Applied dark blue background (`--color-primary-950` to `--color-primary-900` gradient) to Hero section
   - Applied dark blue background (`--color-primary-950`) to the Contact section
   - Used light blue background (`--color-primary-50`) for the Founder section for subtle contrast

3. **Text Color Contrast**:
   - Updated text colors in dark sections to use white text for proper contrast
   - Maintained readable contrast ratios throughout the application
   - Used lighter variants of blue (`--color-primary-200`) for accent text on dark backgrounds
