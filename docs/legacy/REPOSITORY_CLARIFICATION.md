# Repository Management Clarification

## Current Repository Structure

This project currently has two GitHub repositories:

1. **Active Repository (Recommended)**:
   - **Name**: `elmentor-landing-page-clean`
   - **URL**: https://github.com/aymanaboghonim/elmentor-landing-page-clean
   - **GitHub Pages**: https://aymanaboghonim.github.io/elmentor-landing-page-clean/
   - **Status**: ✅ Active, properly configured, and working correctly

2. **Legacy Repository (Obsolete)**:
   - **Name**: `elmentor-landing-page-clean`
   - **URL**: https://github.com/aymanaboghonim/elmentor-landing-page-clean
   - **GitHub Pages**: Not properly configured
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Deprecated, incomplete, and may appear buggy

## Why There Are Two Repositories

During the development of the automated deployment process:

1. We initially created a repository named `elmentor-landing-page-clean`
2. When resolving Git "dubious ownership" issues, we improved our deployment scripts
3. The improved scripts adopted a new naming strategy that includes the GitHub username in the repository name
4. This resulted in the creation of a new repository: `elmentor-landing-page-clean`
5. All deployment efforts and improvements were directed to this new repository

## Recommended Action

To avoid confusion, we recommend one of the following:

1. **Delete the legacy repository** using the provided cleanup script:
   ```
   .\cleanup-old-repo.bat
   ```
   This will permanently delete the `elmentor-landing-page-clean` repository.

2. **Archive the legacy repository** by:
   - Going to GitHub repository settings
   - Scrolling to the "Danger Zone"
   - Clicking "Archive this repository"

## Local Configuration

Your local workspace is correctly configured to use the active repository:
```
origin https://github.com/aymanaboghonim/elmentor-landing-page-clean.git
```

All deployment scripts have been updated to use this repository.
