# Image Status Report

## Fixed Image Assets

The following image placeholders have been updated with professional SVG alternatives:

### 1. Founder Image
- **File**: `src/assets/images/founder-mohamed-radwan.jpg`
- **Status**: ✅ UPDATED
- **Type**: SVG content (with appropriate styling)
- **Description**: Professional looking avatar with Microsoft blue theme, proper name and title
- **Used in**: FounderSection component

### 2. Circles Diagram
- **File**: `public/aymanaboghonim-circles.png`
- **Status**: ✅ UPDATED
- **Type**: SVG content (with appropriate styling)
- **Description**: Complete hierarchical visualization showing all 6 community circles (Audience → Executives)
- **Used in**: CirclesSection component

## Current State

Both images are now using well-designed SVG placeholders rather than basic geometric shapes:

1. The founder image now has a professional Microsoft blue gradient background with a proper avatar silhouette and text elements
2. The circles diagram now shows a complete hierarchical structure with all 6 levels properly labeled and styled

## Next Steps

While these SVG placeholders will allow the site to render correctly, for production use:

1. Run any of the asset copy scripts (`copy-assets.ps1`, `copy-assets.bat`, `copy-assets.js`, etc.) to copy the actual images from the original project
2. Verify that all components render correctly with the real images

All file references in components remain correct, making the switch from placeholder SVGs to real PNGs/JPGs seamless once copying is complete.
