## Key Files

- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component
- `src/main.tsx`: Application entry point
- `vite.config.ts`: Build configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Component Organization

The application uses a component-based architecture:

- **Reusable Components**: `src/components/` contains reusable UI components
- **Page Sections**: `src/components/sections/` contains the main content sections
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, and layout-related components

## Style Organization

Styles are organized using component-specific CSS files:

- Global styles are in `src/styles/index.css`
- Component styles are named to match their component (e.g., `Header.css` for `Header.tsx`)
- CSS variables are used for consistent styling

## Assets Organization

Assets are organized in two locations:

1. **Public Assets**: `public/assets/` contains:
   - Images loaded at runtime
   - Assets referenced directly by URL
   - Large media files

2. **Source Assets**: `src/assets/` contains:
   - Icons and small images used directly in components
   - SVG files that might be processed during build

## Build & Deployment

Deployment scripts are consolidated in the `scripts/` directory:

- `scripts/deploy.ps1`: Main deployment script
- `deploy.bat`: Windows batch file for easy deployment

## Documentation

Documentation is organized in the `docs/` directory:

- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Deployment instructions
- `BRAND_IDENTITY.md`: Brand guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contribution guidelines
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: This file

## Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these structural guidelines:

- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Use appropriate directory structure for new files
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Update documentation when changing the structure
