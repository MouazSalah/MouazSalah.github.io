1. Run `auto-merge-pr.bat` from the repository root
2. Follow the interactive prompts to specify source/target branches
3. Choose whether to attempt automatic conflict resolution

### 2. GitHub Pages Sync Tool

Keep the GitHub Pages deployment in sync with the master branch:

- **Script**: `scripts/sync-gh-pages.ps1`
- **Easy Interface**: `sync-gh-pages.bat`

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows

The repository includes automated GitHub Actions workflows:

#### PR Validation

- Automatically checks PRs for potential merge conflicts
- Validates documentation links to catch broken references

#### Auto-Merge

- Automatically merges PRs that have been approved and labeled
- Requires the "automerge" label to be added to eligible PRs
- Avoids merging PRs with conflicts or failing checks

## Best Practices for Conflict-Free Development

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep feature branches updated with the latest master changes
   - Use `git pull origin master` regularly on your feature branch

2. **Small, Focused PRs**:
   - Create smaller PRs focused on specific changes
   - Break large changes into multiple PRs

3. **Use Labels**:
   - Add the "automerge" label to PRs that can be automatically merged
   - Use "work in progress" label for PRs not ready to merge

4. **Review GitHub Actions Results**:
   - Check the PR validation output for potential conflicts
   - Address any issues before merging

5. **Document Changes Thoroughly**:
   - Use PR templates to clearly explain changes
   - Mention related issues or PRs

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If conflicts still occur:

1. Use the `auto-merge-pr.bat` tool with auto-resolve option for documentation files
2. For code conflicts, review them carefully in a proper merge tool
3. When in doubt, communicate with other contributors about concurrent changes
