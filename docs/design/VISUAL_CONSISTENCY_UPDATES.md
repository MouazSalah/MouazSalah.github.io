# Visual Consistency Updates

This document outlines the visual consistency improvements made to the Elmentor Landing Page to enhance the user experience and brand alignment.

## Background Color Unification

All sections now follow a consistent background pattern to provide visual harmony throughout the site:

1. **Primary Sections** (About, Benefits, News) use a soft blue gradient background with subtle dot patterns
   - Subtle blue gradient: `var(--color-gray-50)` to `var(--color-primary-50)`
   - Dot pattern: `var(--color-primary-100)` with low opacity

2. **Secondary Sections** (Founder, Contact) use a clean white background
   - Background: `var(--color-white)`
   - Subtle borders to provide visual separation

3. **Hero Section** retains its distinctive blue gradient
   - Deep blue gradient for strong visual impact
   - Wave divider for smooth transition

## Navbar Improvements

The grey navbar background has been replaced with a professional gradient:
- Default state: Linear gradient from `rgba(0, 69, 120, 0.85)` to `rgba(0, 120, 212, 0.85)`
- Scrolled state: Subtle gradient with brand color tints

## News Section Enhancements

- Added year-based archive functionality for 2023, 2024, and 2025
- Filter shows only content with public links
- Improved UI with year filter buttons

## Community References Update

- Changed all instances of "DevOps Visions Program Official Channels" to "DevOps Visions Public Community"

## Color Palette Consistency

The site now follows a more consistent application of the defined color palette:
- Primary Blue: `#0078D4` (Microsoft Blue)
- Primary Light: `#DEECF9`
- Secondary: `#605E5C` (Microsoft Gray)
- Background primary: White and subtle blue gradient backgrounds
- Text colors: Maintained consistently across sections
